# url: https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/
# difficulty: Medium

# Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
# 
# The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
# The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
# Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]


from python_solutions.util import tree
